# chess-move-check.py #
Written by: Matthew Lean

### How to Run ###
First you must have Python installed. Then to run the program you input the following command:
`python chess-move-check.py <board-state-txt>`

`<board-state-txt>` represents the file location of the text file that tells the script the current state of the board.

The first line of file must be the current player's color.
Each line afterwards represents a chess piece. They are formatted in this way:
`<Color>,<Piece Name>,<Location>`

You can view some examples in the 'testfiles' folder included with the script.
